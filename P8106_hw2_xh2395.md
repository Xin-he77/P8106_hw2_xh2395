## Homework 2 Description

In this exercise, we build nonlinear models using the “College” data.
The dataset contains statistics for 565 US Colleges from the 1995 issue
of US News and World Report. The response variable is the out-of-state
tuition (Outstate). In what follows, use the data excluding statistics
for Columbia University (i.e., the 125th observation) to train the
models.

## Import the data

``` r
college_df = read_csv("./data/College.csv")
```

## Set random seed

``` r
set.seed(2020)
```
